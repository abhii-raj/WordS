# Multiplayer Word Game Project - Resume Bullet Points

## Full-Stack Development
• **Developed a real-time multiplayer word puzzle game** using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Socket.IO for live gameplay supporting 2-8 concurrent players

• **Implemented dynamic game configuration system** allowing hosts to customize timer settings (5-30 seconds) and word limits (3-4 words per player) with real-time validation

• **Built responsive React frontend** with Vite bundler featuring room management, live chat, player status tracking, and clipboard integration for seamless room sharing

## Backend Engineering
• **Designed RESTful API with Socket.IO integration** managing real-time events for 8+ game phases including lobby management, word submission, and scoring systems

• **Implemented MongoDB data persistence** with Mongoose ODM for room state management, player tracking, and individual word contribution monitoring using optimized array operations

• **Developed robust word validation system** with per-player limits enforcement, preventing exploitation through silent validation and proper state synchronization

## Frontend Development
• **Created interactive game interface** with React hooks and state management handling real-time updates for player submissions, chat messages, and game phase transitions

• **Implemented user experience enhancements** including copy-to-clipboard functionality, dynamic word counters, and responsive design supporting multiple screen sizes

• **Optimized performance** through efficient re-rendering strategies and real-time data synchronization reducing latency for 8+ concurrent users

## Technical Implementation
• **Integrated real-time communication** using Socket.IO with custom event handling for room creation, player coordination, and live game state updates

• **Implemented scoring algorithm** with configurable point systems and real-time leaderboard updates ensuring fair gameplay across multiple rounds

• **Established development workflow** with comprehensive Git configuration, environment management, and proper code organization following industry best practices

## Project Management & Problem Solving
• **Debugged and resolved critical server stability issues** including file corruption handling and memory management for sustained multiplayer sessions

• **Enhanced user interface** based on feedback, implementing silent error handling and streamlined user interactions for improved player experience

• **Maintained code quality** through proper error handling, input validation, and comprehensive testing across different user scenarios and edge cases
